OSI Model: Open System Interconnection Model
--------------------------------------------
It describes how the data is transmitted from one computer to another computer in a computer network. (Two or more devices connected via internet).

In the most basic from 2 computers connected using LAN and connectors (RJ45) shares data using Network Interface Card forms Computer Networks.
But if both the computers have different OS its communication happens using the OSI model.

OSI MODEL: It was introduced by International Organization of Standardization
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It comprises of 7 layers:
1. Application Layer
2. Presentation Layer
3. Session Layer
4. Transport Layer
5. Network Layer
6. DataLink Layer
7. Physical Layer

" Each Layer contains Package of protocols "

1. Application Layer: It provides services to the Network Applications
---------------------
Network Application: Computer Applications that requires Internet.
It contains protocols that helps to make the network applications like chrome, firefox work correctly.

The network applications use application layer protocols. There are dozens of Application Layer protocols 
(HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SNMP, DHCP, IRC, POP3, TELNET) each having its own functionalities.
1. File Transfer = FTP
2. Web Surfing = HTTP, HTTPS
3. Emails = SMTP
4. Virtual Terminals = Telnet

2. Presentation Layer:
----------------------
- It receives data from Application Layer
- It is in the form of correctors and numbers
- It translates the correctors and numbers into machine understandable code (Translation)
1. Translation
2. Before the data is transmitted the translated bits are reduced (It can be lossy /lossless) - it is done for faster data transmission
3. Encryption - uses SSL Secure Socket Layer (SSL) is used for encryption and decryption in presentation Layer

3. Session Layer:
----------------
